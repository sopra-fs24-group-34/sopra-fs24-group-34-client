## Introduction

Bringing the beloved board game "Guess Who?" to the digital realm, our web application offers a competitive and enjoyable character guessing game to play with a friend This is the repository of the front-end part of our implementation, you'll find the back-end part [here](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-34/sopra-fs24-group-34-server).

## Technologies

The client is written in TypeScript using React and styled with SASS.

To establish a connection between the front- and backend a RESTful API is used. When further proceeding in the web application (inviting players, playing a game), a stomp websocket connection is established.
